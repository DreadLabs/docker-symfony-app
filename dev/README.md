# docker-symfony-app-dev

## Description

A Symfony application dev image.

## Configuration

### Debugging

The setup was tested with PhpStorm 2017.2.4. Please have a look at the following screenshots and setup your IDE accordingly.

#### Build, Execution, Deployment / Deployment

No deployment setup is necessary for debugging.

#### Languages & Frameworks / PHP / Debug

**Note**: I left out the upper part "Pre-Configuration" as it serves informational purposes only.

No special configuration here. If I remember correctly, these settings match the standard configuration for new PHP projects.

#### Languages & Frameworks / PHP / Debug / DBGp Proxy

Some tutorials mentioned to configure this in a certain way. But this is not necessary if you're not going to use a DBGp Proxy.

#### Languages & Frameworks / PHP / Servers

This part is very important to be machted against the `PHP_IDE_CONFIG` setting within the container.

Create a new configuration, named `app`. Set up the path mappings accordingly. In this example, I created a project, containing
multiple applications (`api`, `auth`, ...). The directory `api` contains a Symfony application. In most cases, the contents of
this directory will reside in the root of the PhpStorm project.

Map the application's root directory to `/app` and additionally (may be not necessary) map the application's `web` directory
to `/app/web`.

#### Run configuration

In order to run (`^ R`) or debug (`^ D`) the application on demand, I suggest to create a configuration for it:
Select from menu `Run` / `Edit configurations`. Hit the upper left `+`-Icon and select `PHP Web Application`.

## Features

### PHP CLI debugging

Click on the icon named "Start Listening for PHP Debug Connections". Then, to run the application console with debugging 
capabilities, simply prefix the `app/console` command with `php-dbg`:

    php-dbg app/console

### app_dev.php access

This Docker image should only be used in development contexts. To allow access to Symfony's `app_dev.php` front controller,
it will populate the custom FastCGI parameter `X_ALLOW_DEBUG` with the value `yes` to the `php-fpm`/FastCGI server.

You should adjust the `app_dev.php` the following way in order to grant access in the context of this setup:

Default:

    if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])
        || isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])
        || !(in_array(@$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], array('127.0.0.1', '::1')) || php_sapi_name() === 'cli-server')
    ) {
        header('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden');
        exit('You are not allowed to access this file. Check '.basename(__FILE__).' for more information.');
    }

New:

    if (!(@$_SERVER['X_ALLOW_DEBUG'] === 'yes')
        && (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])
        || isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])
        || !(in_array(@$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], array('127.0.0.1', '::1')) || php_sapi_name() === 'cli-server'))
    ) {
        header('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden');
        exit('You are not allowed to access this file. Check '.basename(__FILE__).' for more information.');
    }

## Makefile

Tested with GNU Make 3.81. `VERSION` environment variable defaults to `latest`.
